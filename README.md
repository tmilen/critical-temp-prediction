## ðŸ“Š Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [UCI Superconductivity Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/464/superconductivty+data).
The **Superconductivity Dataset** consists of **21263 observations** with **81 features**, representing various material properties used to predict the **critical temperature** of superconductors.

## ðŸš€ Models Used
Multiple machine learning models were trained and fine-tuned to predict **Tc**:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Tree** 
4. **Random Forest**
